You won't get much closer
Till you sacrifice it all (all)
You won't get to taste it
With your face against the wall (wall wall)
Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within (in, in)
Do just what you want to
And now stand up and begin
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station
Doubts will try to break you
Unleash your heart and soul (soul)
Trouble will surround you
Start taking some control-(trol!)
Stand up and deliver
Your wildest fantasy-(sy-sy)
Do what the fuck you want to
There's no one to appease
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Oooh 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
And I know that you will fight for the duration
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And I know I'm not resisting the temptations
Oooh 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at Panic Station!
